Front-end. Development technologies that can help you with building the interface for interaction with your users. The mobile app's layout includes the interface developers' products, such as buttons, animations, hush function, business logic, and links. Thus, a mobile app's back-end handles the server-side code and the database.

Platform. A mobile platform such as iOS or Android provides the operating system and development tools to build and run the app. This might include technologies like iOS SDK or Android SDK and programming languages such as Objective-C, Swift, Java, or Kotlin.
